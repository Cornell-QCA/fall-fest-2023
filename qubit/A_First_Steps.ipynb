This gate puts a qubit into a superposition, which hopefully you've already learned in one of your Fall Fest workshops! We can apply a hadamard gate simply, by using `.h()` and writing the target qubit number inside the parenthesis.\n","\n","The last gate we'll look at for now is the CNOT gate. There's a lot of ways to examine what this gate is or what it does. To keep it simple, let's say that this is the entanglement gate. It entangles two qubits together. We apply a CNOT gate by using `.cx()` and writing the two qubit numbers in the parenthesis.\n","\n","Time to see each of these in
